Easy add site-wide and/or article specific custom code before the closing &lt;/head&gt; and &lt;/body&gt;, or opening &lt;body&gt; tag.

== Description ==

**Head &amp; Footer Code** plugin helps you add custom code snippets (JavaScript, CSS, or HTML) to the page even if you are not a programmer.  It could be `<head>` (site verification code for various services, custom styles, meta or Webfont link), just before `</body>` or right after opening `<body>` (pixel tracking, analytics or heatmap code).

Go to **Tools** &rarr; **Head &amp; Footer Code** in WordPress Dashboard. Insert custom code to HEAD, BODY or FOOTER section (depending on what you have to do).

If your WordPress shows the latest blog posts on the homepage, you can also add specific code only for the homepage on **Tools** &rarr; **Head &amp; Footer Code** (there will be section **Head, body and footer code on Homepage in Blog Posts mode**)

To insert custom code specific for individual article (post, page or custom post type), use article-specific Metabox while editing post/page/custom post type (check out [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/head-footer-code/#screenshots)). There choose if that specific code appends to site-wide code defined on **Tools** &rarr; **Head &amp; Footer Code**, or to replace it.

Taxonomies (category, tag and custom taxonomy listing, individual category, tags and custom taxonomies) do not have their specific code. Global code uses instead.

This magic is done by hooking to WordPress hooks `wp_head`, `wp_footer` and `wp_body_open`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is supported PHP code in code snippets? =

As it's a security risk, the **Head &amp; Footer Code** does not process PHP code if entered into any plugin field (global or article specific).

Any content added to HFC fields is printed on the front-end as is.

= I entered code to BODY section, but nothing outputs on front-end =

This feature is implemented since WordPress version 5.2 and requires theme compatibility.

To make sure if theme you use supports [wp_body_open](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/wp_body_open/) hook, open in code editor `header.php` file from theme you use, and check if right after opening `<BODY>` tag there is following code (if it does not exists, add it or ask some developer to do that for you):

```
if ( function_exists( 'wp_body_open' ) ) {
    wp_body_open();
}
```
