     temperature of 0.8 to 1.6Â°C (since the 1990s) are expected.
     Rainfall will continue to be very variable over time, but over the long term it is
     expected to continue to decline in winter and spring (medium to high confidence),
     and autumn (low to medium confidence), but with some chance of little change.
     Extreme rainfall events are expected to become more intense 
     on average through the century (high confidence) 
     but remain very variable in space and time. By the 2050s,
